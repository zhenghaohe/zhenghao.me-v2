TypeScript’s never type is very under-discussed. It’s not nearly as ubiquitous or inescapable as other types. A TypeScript beginner can probably ignore never type. It only features when dealing with advanced types, such as conditional types, or reading their cryptic type error messages.

Actually, `never` type has quite a few good uses in TypeScript; however, it also has its own pitfalls you need to be careful of.

In this blog post, I will cover:
- The meaning of `never` type and why we need it.
- Practical applications and pitfalls of `never`.

## What is never type
To fully understand never type and its purposes, we must first understand what a type is, and what role it plays in a type system.

A type is a **set** of possible values. For example, string type represents an infinite set of possible strings. When we annotate a variable with type `string`, such a variable can only have values from within that set, i.e. strings:
```typescript
let foo: string = 'foo'
foo = 3 // ❌ number is not in the set of strings
```
In TypeScript, `never` is an **empty set** of values. In fact, in Flow, another popular JavaScript type system, the equivalent type is called exactly [Empty](https://github.com/facebook/flow/commit/c603505583993aa953904005f91c350f4b65d6bd)

Since there’s no values in the set, never type can’t have any value, including values of `any` type. That’s why never is also sometimes referred to as an [uninhabitable type](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/134215/what-is-an-uninhabited-type) or a [bottom type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_type). 

```typescript
declare const any: any
const never: never = any // ❌ type 'any' is not assignable to type 'never'
```

The bottom type is how [the TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes-func.html#other-important-typescript-types) defines it. I found it makes more sense when we place `never` in the [type hierarchy tree](https://www.zhenghao.io/posts/type-hierarchy-tree#the-bottom-of-the-tree), a mental model I use to understand [subtyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping)

The next logical question is, why do we need `never` type? 
## Why we need never type
Just like we have **zero** in our number system to denote the quantity of nothing, we needs a type to denote **impossibility** in our type system. 

The word "impossibility" itself is vague. In TypeScript, “impossibility” manifests itself in various ways, namely:
- An empty type that can't have any value, which can be used to represent the following:
    - Inadmissible type parameters passed to a generic type, or unwanted argument types passed to functions.
    - Intersection of incompatible types.
    - An empty union (a union type of nothingness).
- The return type of a function that never returns control to the caller when it finishes executing, e.g., `process.exit` in Node
    - Not to confuse it with `void`, as `void` means a function doesn’t return anything useful to the caller.
- An else branch that should never be entered in a condition type
- The fulfilled value's type for a rejected `promise`
    ```typescript
        const p = Promise.reject('foo') // const p: Promise<never>
    ```

### How never works with unions and intersections
Analogous to how number zero works in addition and multiplication, `never` type has special properties when used in union types and intersection types:
- `never` gets dropped from union types, similiar to when zero added to a number gives the same number.
    - e.g. `type Res = never | string // string`

- `never` overrides other types in intersection types, similiar to when zero multiplying a number gives zero.
    - e.g. `type Res = never & string  // never`

These two behaviors/characteristics of `never` type lay the foundation for some of its important use cases that we will see later on.

## How to use never type
While you probably wouldn’t find yourself use `never` a lot, there are quite a few legit use cases for it:

### Annotate inadmissible function arguments to impose restrictions
Since we can never (pun-intended) assign a value to `never` type, we can use it to impose restrictions on functions for various use cases.

#### Ensure Exhaustive matching within switch and if-else statement

If a function can only take one argument of `never` type, that function can never (pun-intended) be called (without the TypeScript compiler yelling at us):

```typescript
function fn(input: never) {}

fn() // ❌ passing anything (or nothing) to `fn` causes a type error 
```

We can use such a function to ensure exhaustive matching within switch and if-else statement: by using it as the default case, we ensure that all cases are covered, since what remains must be of type `never`. If we accidentally leave out a possible match, we get a type error. For example:

```typescript
function unknownColor(x: never): never {
    throw new Error("unknown color");
}


type Color = 'red' | 'green' | 'blue'

function getColorName(c: Color): string {
    switch(c) {
        case 'red':
            return 'is red';
        case 'green':
            return 'is green';
        default:
            return unknownColor(c); // Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'
    }
}

```

> [TkDodo](https://twitter.com/TkDodo) also wrote a great and detailed [blog post](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/exhaustive-matching-in-type-script) about implementing exhaustive matching in TypeScript with `never`.

#### Partially "disallow" structural typing
Let’s say we have a function that takes an argument of either the type `VariantA` or `VariantB`. But, the user mustn’t pass a type encompassing all properties from both types, i.e., a [subtype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping) of both types.

We can leverage a union type `VariantA | VariantB` for the argument. However, since TypeScript uses structural typing, passing a type that’s a subtype to the argument’s type is allowed (unless you pass object literals):

```typescript
type VariantA = {
    a: string,
}

type VariantB = {
    b: number,
}

declare function fn(arg: VariantA | VariantB): void


const input = {a: 'foo', b: 123 }
fn(input) // TypeScript doens't complain but this shouldn't be allowed for our use case
```
The above code snippet doesn't give us a type error in TypeScript. 

By using `never`, we can partially "disable" structural typing and prevent users from passing object values that include both properties:

```typescript
type VariantA = {
    a: string
    b?: never
}

type VariantB = {
    b: number
    a?: never
}

declare function fn(arg: VariantA | VariantB): void


const input = {a: 'foo', b: 123 }
fn(input) // ❌ Types of property 'a' are incompatible
```

#### Prevent unintended API usage
Let’s say we want to create a `Cache` instance to read and store data from/to it:

```typescript
type Read = {}
type Write = {}
declare const toWrite: Write

declare class MyCache<T, R> {
  put(val: T): boolean;
  get(): R;
}

const cache = new MyCache<Write, Read>()
cache.put(toWrite) // ✅ allowed
```

Now, for some reason we want to have a read-only cache only allowing for reading data via the `get` method. We can type the argument of the `put` method as `never` so it can’t accept any value passed in it:

```typescript
declare class ReadOnlyCache<R> extends MyCache<never, R> {} 
                        // Now type parameter `T` inside MyCache becomes `never`

const readonlyCache = new ReadOnlyCache<Read>()
readonlyCache.put(data) // ❌ Argument of type 'Data' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.
```

> Unrelated to `never` type, as a side note, my friend [Josh](https://twitter.com/JoshuaKGoldberg) pointed out that this particular example, where `ReadOnlyCache`, as a derived class of `MyCache`, forcefully prevents the use of the `put` method might not be a good use case for derived classes here. I am not really an expert on object-oriented programming, so please use your own judgment.


### Denote theoretically unreachable conditional branches
When using `infer` to create an additional type variable inside a conditional type, we must add an else branch for every `infer` keyword:

```typescript
type A = 'foo';
type B = A extends infer C ? (
    C extends 'foo' ? true : false// inside this expression, C represents A
) : never // this branch is unreachable but we cannot omit it
```

<details>
    <summary>Why is this `extends infer` combo useful?</summary>
    <p>In my previous post I mentioned how you can create declare “local (type) variable” together with `extends infer`. Check it out [here](/posts/type-programming#local-variable-declaration) if you haven’t seen it.</p>

### Filter out union members from union types
As we have discussed this before, when used as a union member, `never` type is removed automatically. In other words, the `never` type is useless in a union type.
When we are writing a util type to select union members from a union type based on certain criteria, `never` type's "uselessness" makes it the perfect type to be placed in the else branch. 

Let's say we want a util type `ExtractTypeByName` to extracts the union members with `name` property matching a string union type and filter out those that don't match:

```typescript
type Foo = {
    name: 'foo'
    id: number
}

type Bar = {
    name: 'bar'
    id: number
}

type All = Foo | Bar

type ExtractTypeByName<T, G> = T extends {name: G} ? T : never

type ExtractedType = ExtractTypeByName<All, 'foo'> // the result type is Foo
```

<details>
    <summary>See how this works in detail</summary>
    <p>Here are a list of steps TypeScript folllows to evaluate and get the resultant type:</p>
        1. Conditional types are distributed over union types (namely, `Name` in this case):
            ```typescript
            type ExtractedType = ExtractTypeByName<All, Name> 
            ⬇️                    
            type ExtractedType = ExtractTypeByName<Foo | Bar, 'foo'>
            ⬇️    
            type ExtractedType = ExtractTypeByName<Foo, 'foo'> | ExtractTypeByName<Bar, 'foo'>
            ```
        2. Substitue the implementation and evaluate separately
            ```typescript
            type ExtractedType = Foo extends {name: 'foo'} ? Foo : never 
                                | Bar extends {name: 'foo'} ? Bar : never
            ⬇️
            type ExtractedType = Foo | never
            ```
        3. Remove `never` from the union
            ```typescript
            type ExtractedType = Foo | never
            ⬇️
            type ExtractedType = Foo
            ```
</details>

### Filter out keys in mapped types
In TypeScript, types are immutable. If we want to delete a property from an object type, we must create a new one by transforming and filtering the existing one. When we conditionally [re-map keys](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/mapped-types.html#key-remapping-via-as) in mapped types to `never`, those keys get filtered out.

Here’s an example for a `Filter` type that filters out object type properties based on their value types.

```typescript
type Filter<Obj extends Object, ValueType> = {
    [Key in keyof Obj 
        as ValueType extends Obj[Key] ? Key : never]
        : Obj[Key]
}



interface Foo {
    name: string;
    id: number;
}


type Filtered = Filter<Foo, string>; // {name: string;}
```

### Narrow types in control flow analysis

When we type a function’s return value as `never`, that means the function never returns.
A function can never return for several reasons: it might throw an exception on all code paths, it might loop forever, or it exits from the program e.g. `process.exit`. This means such a function doesn't return control to the caller when it finishes executing. This information is invaluable for control flow analysis to narrow down types. 

In the following code snippet, we use a function that returns `never` type to strip away undefined from the union type for `foo`:

```typescript
function throwError(): never {
    throw new Error();
}

let foo: string | undefined;

if (!foo) {
    throwError();
}

foo; // string
```

Or invoke `throwError` after `||` or `??` operator:

```typescript

let foo: string | undefined;

const guaranteedFoo = foo ?? throwError(); // string
```

### Denote impossible intersections of incompatible types

This one might feel more like a behavior/characteristic of the TypeScript language than a practical application for `never`. Nevertheless, it’s vital for understanding some of the cryptic error messages you might come across.

You can get `never` type by intersecting incompatible types

```typescript
type Never = number & string // never
```
And you get `never` type by intersecting any types with `never`

```typescript
type Never = number & never // never
```

## How to read never type (from error messages)
You might have gotten error messages involving an unexpected `never` type from code you didn’t annotate with `never` explicitly. That’s usually because the TypeScript compiler intersects the types. It does this implicitly for you to retain type safety and to ensure soundness.
Here’s an example that I used in my previous blog post on type functions:

```typescript
type ReturnTypeByInputType = {
  int: number
  char: string
  bool: boolean
}

function getRandom<T extends 'char' | 'int' | 'bool'>(
  str: T
): ReturnTypeByInputType[T] {
  if (str === 'int') {
    // generate a random number
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) 
  } else if (str === 'char') {
    // generate a random char
    return String.fromCharCode(
      97 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 26)
    )
  } else {
    // generate a random boolean
    return Boolean(Math.round(Math.random()))
  }
}
```
The function returns either a number, a string, or a boolean depending on the type of argument we pass. We use an indexes access `ReturnTypeByInputType[T]` to retrieve the corresponding return type.

It looks correct. But if you copy and paste it into [TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/C4TwDgpgBAShwFcBOA7AKuCAhEBJFYCwGkUAvFAN4BQUUAlisAFxQoIC2ARhErVAGMAFgEMkrAM7AkjAOb8uAe0UAbVktUQRKagF9q1AGYIUA4PUUoos+DG0ATRRwA8aKBAAewCCnsSoAOTCYgFQAD6BjMChEQEaKgEAfAAU-FLiUGjUAJSscIioJNh4BERFANpoALpU-PSGUMnp5GQUAVEB2bV0dAD0vdY+vCLeUCJQSA5ObJw8fD0T8MhWALIjQgB0hirKSMlrwJuTvk7JXQBUUACMAAxd-LruKhLQ9Y3NrW3BSJ3dPf2DFDDUbjY6ODiCUTzHpIJaoKAAZWkci2SCcAGEoejFPYIKkFnQAJwAdigAGooAdNttdvt1hswacLlAAEwANmy-DonLojwgz2gNAWAJsQMmIImUwh8S0OgWsIKViwyhUsrphwZihM9nVRylZ2yPKg+l0QA) you’d see that for every return statement we have a type error, namely: `Type X is not assignable to type 'never'` where `X` is string or number or boolean, depending on the branch.

This is where TypeScript tries to help us narrow down the possibility of problematic states in our program: each return value should be assignable to the type `ReturnTypeByInputType[T]` (as we annotated in the example) where `ReturnTypeByInputType[T]` at runtime could end up being either a number, a string, or a boolean. 

Type safety can only be achieved if we make sure that the return type is assignable to all possible `ReturnTypeByInputType[T]`, i.e. the **intersection** of number , string, and boolean.
And what’s the intersection of these 3 types? It’s exactly `never` as they are incompatible with each other. That’s why we are seeing `never` in the error messages.

To work around this, you must use type assertions (or function overloads):
 - `return Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) as ReturnTypeByInputType[T]`
 - `return Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) as never`

Another more obvious example:
```typescript
function f1(obj: { a: number, b: string }, key: 'a' | 'b') {
    obj[key] = 1;    // Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'never'.
    obj[key] = 'x';  // Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'never'.
}

```

`obj[key]` could end up being either a string or a number depending on the value of key at runtime. Therefore, TypeScript added this constraint, i.e., any values we write to `obj[key]` must be compatible with both types, string and number, just to be safe. So, it intersects both types and gives us `never` type.

## How to check for never

Checking if a type is `never` is harder than it should be.


Consider the following code snippet:

```typescript
type IsNever<T> = T extends never ? true : false

type T = IsNever<never> // 'never' 🧐
```

Is `T` `true` or `false`? It might surprise you that the answer is neither: `T` is actually `never`.

It definitely threw me off the first time I came across this. [@TitianCernicova](https://twitter.com/TitianCernicova) from Twitter has a [thread](https://twitter.com/TitianCernicova/status/1495784001323290627) explaining this quite well from the perspective of `never` being an empty union semantically:
- TypeScript distributes union types in conditional types automatically
- `never` is an empty union
- Therefore, when distribution happens there’s nothing to distribute over, so the conditional type resolves to `never` again.

The only workaround here is to opt out of the implicit distribution and to wrap the type parameter in a tuple:

```typescript
type IsNever<T> = [T] extends [never] ? true : false;
type T = IsNever<never> // 'true' ✅
type T = IsNever<number> // 'false' ✅
```
This is actually straight out of [TypeScript’s source code](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/tests/cases/conformance/types/conditional/conditionalTypes1.ts#L212) and TypeScript should’ve exposed this externally in my opinion.



## In summary
We covered quite a lot in this blog post:
- we talked about `never` type's definition and purposes.
- we talked about its various use cases:
    - imposing restrictions on functions by leveraging the fact that `never` is an empty type
    - filtering out unwanted union members and object type's keys/properties
    - aiding control flow analysis
    - denoting invalid or unreachable conditional branches
- we also talked about how it can come up unexpectedly in type error messages due to implicit type intersection
- lastly we covered how you can check if a type is indeed never type.
