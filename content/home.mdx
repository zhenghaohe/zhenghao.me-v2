I am a software engineer based in Vancouver, Canada. I am currently working at Instacart. 

This website is my humble abode on the internet, where I pen my musings in [here](/posts) about software development, specifically JavaScript, TypeScript and web technologies in general. 

If you enjoy my content, consider subscribing to my [RSS feed](/rss.xml). If you feel so inclined, you're welcome to [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/zhenghaohez).
